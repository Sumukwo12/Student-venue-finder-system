CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.1	Introduction
It’s important to manage venues in higher institutions, where classrooms, auditoriums and study rooms are in high demand for academic and other extracurricular activities. Here in Laikipia University students and administrators face a lot of challenges in managing venues because of it is reliance on manual booking processes which is inefficient and may lead to double booking, unused locations and also poor communication between lecturers and students (Mclaughlin et al., 2019).

Am proposing for digital system called student venue finder that aims to improve venue management at Laikipia University. This applications has features like real-time venue checking and availability, a booking module, search and filter module, admin dashboard to manage venues and a upload module used by admins to upload timetable in excel format. This chapter focuses on the study’s background, problems, purposes, goals, research questions, justifications, scopes and limitations.
1.2	Background of the Study

Most higher institutions globally use technologies to improve their working and resource management. However, some still use outdated manual systems for booking venues which leads to inefficiency and mistakes (Davis, 1989). Outdated methods such as using latters or emails can be slow, cause double booking or even misunderstanding between students and administrators.

Here in Laikipia University, venue booking for Lectures and other non-academic activities is done manually, which leads to a lot of problems. With increasing population of students and stuffs the need for advanced resource management is needed to ensures maximum utilization and efficiency. Thus a digital solution is needed to ensure venue bookings are easier and moreefficient.
This proposed system ‘Student Venue Finder’ is designed to provide solutions to these problems by providing a platform that provides real-time venue availability, easy booking features. According to Mclaughlin et al. (2019), real-time venue management systems are crucial in reducing these errors and improving communication between students and university stuff. This proposed System/platform is made to reduce workload for administrators, increase transparency and also improve the uses of venues/space at Laikipia University.
1.3	Statement of the Problem
 
Laikipia University are currently using manual/outdated/traditional processes to manage it’s venues which are time consuming, inefficient and usually lead to mistakes. Lack of real-time automated systems makes it difficult and complicated to locate available venues, lead to double bookings, delayed responses to venues requests, unused space, lead to confusions and time wasting. This inefficiency affects both students and administrators leading to frustrations thus limiting universities ability to utilize it’s resources efficiently. Without improved and digitalized solutions these problems will continue thus limiting the universities ability to meet the increasing demand for venues. According to Davis(1989), technology that improves user interaction and automates manual tasks can greatly enhance operational efficiency. The proposed student venue finder aiming to provide solutions to these issues be providing digital solutions that automates real-time venue finding, booking and integrates real-time availability to improve resource management.

2.5	Timetable upload module

This module is designed for administrators use to ease work of uploading data to database for student use. It’s funtion is to feed database with timetable contents so to be searched by students and identify the unoccupied venues. This module allows administrators to upload already created timetable in xml format to the database at the beginning of a semester in order to be used by students in searching and booking venues.
2.6	Theoretical framework.

Theoretical frameworks for student venue finder system is simply based on Human- Computer Interaction (HCI) theory and Information System Success Model (ISSM). Theory
 
of HCI emphasizes on system designing that align with human cognitive processes, usability and interactive design (Davis, 1989). ISSN, developed by Delone and Mclean (2003), evaluates success of a system through system quality, information quality, user satisfaction and impact on the university.

These theories provide a foundation for developing and designing a perfect user interface and assessing the effectiveness of the system to the university students and staff. Through integration of these frameworks, this study ensures a user-centred approach, addressing both technical and human understanding to enhance student productivity and streamline venue searching and booking process.
2.7	Conceptual framework

The conceptual framework for this study outlines the relationship between the system’s independent features like real time updates and user friendly interface and also the dependent features/variables such as user satisfaction. The system performances in providing real-time updates and ease of use is expected to impact and influence student and administrative performance at Laikipia university.
