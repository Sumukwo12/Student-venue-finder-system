Abstract
 
Student Venue Finder simplifies finding, booking and managing venues at Laikipia University. This application offers an efficient and user-friendly venue reservation system, saving users time and effort. This application boasts a remarkably strong real- time venue checking and booking availability system and a thorough booking system. Furthermore, it offers a completely featured admin dashboard, an exceptionally advanced admin upload module for timetable uploads to the database in Excel format, allowing user filtering and a central database for secure data storage. The application's advanced filter module simplifies venue selection by enabling users to filter and search. This application enables administrators to quickly and efficiently find, book and manage many venues and it offers students the same high degree of user-friendliness. This student venue finder system improves venue organization and user experience by providing a single, efficient tool for everyone. The application's user interface will be built with HTML, PHP and Javascript; CSS will handle all styling; PHP will manage all server-side scripting; and MYSQL will manage the entire database


   
chapter 1

introduction

It’s important to manage venues in higher institutions, where classrooms, auditoriums and study rooms are in high demand for academic and other extracurricular activities. Here in Laikipia University students and administrators face a lot of challenges in managing venues because of it is reliance on manual booking processes which is inefficient and may lead to double booking, unused locations and also poor communication between lecturers and students (Mclaughlin et al., 2019).
Am proposing for digital system called student venue finder that aims to improve venue management at Laikipia University. This applications has features like real- time venue checking and availability, a booking module, search and filter module, admin dashboard to manage venues and a upload module used by admins to upload timetable in excel format. This chapter focuses on the study’s background, problems, purposes, goals, research questions, justifications, scopes and limitations.
Most higher institutions globally use technologies to improve their working and resource management. However, some still use outdated manual systems for booking venues which leads to inefficiency and mistakes (Davis, 1989). Outdated methods such as using latters or emails can be slow, cause double booking or even misunderstanding between students and administrators.
Here in Laikipia University, venue booking for Lectures and other non-academic activities is done manually, which leads to a lot of problems. With increasing population of students and stuffs the need for advanced resource management is needed to ensures maximum utilization and efficiency. Thus a digital solution is needed to ensure venue bookings are easier and more efficient.
This proposed system ‘Student Venue Finder’ is designed to provide solutions to these problems by providing a platform that provides real-time venue availability,
 
easy booking features. According to Mclaughlin et al. (2019), real-time venue management systems are crucial in reducing these errors and improving communication between students and university stuff. This proposed System/platform is made to reduce workload for administrators, increase transparency and also improve the uses of venues/space at Laikipia University.
Laikipia University are currently using manual/outdated/traditional processes to manage it’s venues which are time consuming, inefficient and usually lead to mistakes. Lack of real-time automated systems makes it difficult and complicated to locate available venues, lead to double bookings, delayed responses to venues requests, unused space, lead to confusions and time wasting. This inefficiency affects both students and administrators leading to frustrations thus limiting universities ability to utilize it’s resources efficiently.
Without improved and digitalized solutions these problems will continue thus limiting the universities ability to meet the increasing demand for venues. According to Davis(1989), technology that improves user interaction and automates manual tasks can greatly enhance operational efficiency. The proposed student venue finder aiming to provide solutions to these issues be providing digital solutions that automates real-time venue finding, booking and integrates real-time availability to improve resource management.

The main goal of this study is to build and test the ‘Student Venue Finder’ system. This application is designed to ease booking and manage venues at university. The system aims to provide real-time information on venue availability, allow students to book spaces efficiently, enable students to search/find venues easily, prevent double booking and ensure maximum utilization of resources.
 
a.	To understand the gaps in the existing manual booking system.
b.	To identify requirements needed for a venue finder that meets student's needs.
c.	To show the potential impact of the proposed system to universities management.

 
a.	what are this gaps and how are they can be solved by the new system?
b.	what are the key features required for effective student venue finder system?
c.	What are the potential impacts of the proposed system to the management?

The current manual system for managing venues at the university is inefficient and lacks a real-time automated platform, which makes it hard to find available venue, leading to double bookings, delayed responses to venue requests, unused venues and it’s time consuming.
The implementation of a digital platform solves these issues by automating the process thus significantly reducing workload administrators, improve communication between staff and students and ensure optimal use of available venues(Dlamini,2021) The systems real-time updates will further streamline the process benefiting both the university and it’s students.
By improving venue management, this proposed system will enhance the learning environment at the university, which ensures that students have easy access to resources they need for academic and extracurricular activities.
This study goal is on cresting a digital platform for managing venues at the university. The target users are the students and administrators who are involved in booking and managing venues. The will be tested on the university to see how effective it is.
 
The study may have some limitations which includes limited development timeline due to academic timeline and resources available thus the study will focus on developing a prototype of the student venue finder with limited database. While the platform will address student needs. These limitations will be addressed through user training and implementation process to ensure smooth adoption
